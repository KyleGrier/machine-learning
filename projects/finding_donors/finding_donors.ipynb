    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "Decision trees have been known to work in such use cases as app recommendation. A user of a app aggregation service could pick a few apps which would then be considered features used by the decision tree classifier. By splitting against those choices of apps, the classifier can choose what niche category of applications the user would probably desire to download from next.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the decision tree can find features that split the data well, then not only will it be a good classifier but it could also be used as an invaluable metric in deciding what features are the most relevant for learning an accurate hypothesis. The decision tree will also perform well if there plenty of high information gain splitting features that are ubiquitous across both the test and training set. That way it won't overfit because the features it splits on have relevance to not only the but all future unmarked sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, decision trees can be prone to overfitting if enthused with too many features. These features could perhaps split the training set well but when put to testing, they will be irrelevant and lead classifications astray. Decision trees are also not great at extracting linear combinations of features. They have also been shown to worse a generalizing then other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees will be a good choice for this data because there are many features that could split the data very well, such as age, occupation, and working class. It also could be a good initial model for the process because it could be used to glean important features. Finally decision trees work well when doing a binary classification as in this case.\n",

    "Due to worse performance in both accuracy and F-score, decision trees will not be considered for the final model especially since adaboost is in many ways a more aware decision tree. The LinearSVC and AdaBoost performed very similarly for most metrics. LinearSVC had a reasonable advantage in terms of run time performance but AdaBoost performed slightly better in both accuracy and fscore. I have decided to use the AdaBoost method because the goal is to get the most accurate model and there are many ways I could see of improving the method from it's initial base such as increasing the amount estimators and perhaps using a different base estimator to ground the algorithm. The Adaboost algorithm is also great for viewing the most relevant features in the dataset. \n"

    "The final model, based on the AdaBoost method, is trained by using a decision tree and slowly making that decision tree better and better through updates. A decision tree works by picking some features (such as age and occupation) and splitting all the prospective donators by these criteria. Say we were trying to decide whether an animal was going to bark at us. If we were to split all prospective animals by whether they were a dog or not a dog, then the ones classified as dog would bark and the others probably wouldn't unless they are a weirdo. Now since we are splitting on features, we also want to know which individual gives us the most bang for our buck when we try to split due to them. So those individuals that we consistently get wrong with our decision tree classification will be weighted differently on each pass so that the decision knows how to prioritze it's limited amount of splits. After many iterations of splitting and weighting of the individual we will aggregate all of the decision trees we have made into one final one which will have accumulated a specified interpretatinon of the dataset. With this model we can plug in new individuals and the model will state whether the individual is going to donate or not.  "

The model has a slight improvement from the unoptimized to the optimized model,which is good, but I wish it was a bit more significant. Perhaps some of the other algorithms would see a much greater improvement due to parameter tuning. Regardless, a slight boost is always good especially since the model is getting pretty close to perfect accuracy.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The final model with the reduced data set has a slight advantage in accuracy and F-score. This is perhaps because the model is less likely to overfit the data. Due to this performance boost I would definitely use the reduced data set when time was a factor. As long as all the features are all relatively significant, the scores would decrease too much in some cases and in others it could stand to significantly improve in scores. The model is only as good as the features it tests on and if it can remove confusing features than it is better off. "
